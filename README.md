# Gas Puzzles

These are the exercises from the Udemy course [Advanced Solidity: Understanding and Optimizing Gas Costs](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-solidity-understanding-and-optimizing-gas-costs/).

The idea is to optimize the gas cost for each of the contracts. I'm currently working on the solutions under [contracts/optimized](contracts/optimized)
